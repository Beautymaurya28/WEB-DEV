# React + Tailwind Setup â€“ Web Dev Monday by Nova

This project is part of my Supernova Placement Journey,
specifically for Monday's Web Development schedule. The main goal of this session was to set up a solid React project using Vite, 
integrate Tailwind CSS, and organize the folder structure for scalable development.

## What I Did

### 1. React Project Setup with Vite
I created the project using Vite for faster development and better performance.

Command used:
```bash
npm create vite@latest
